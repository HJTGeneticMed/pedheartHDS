**Hemodynamic trends within the first year after pediatric heart transplantation are dependent on pre-transplant variables and the presence of new or persistent rejection**

Pediatric heart transplant (HT) recipients represent a clinically diverse population, yet expected trajectories of intracardiac hemodynamics (HDS) during the first post-transplant year remain poorly defined. While adult studies suggest early post-HT HDS abnormalities often improve over time, pediatric-specific data remain limited and heterogeneous. Furthermore, the influence of pre-HT variables such as diagnosis and age on post-HT HDS normalization has not been systematically studied.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of pediatric HT recipients to define and characterize intracardiac hemodynamic values within the first year post-HT in patients without rejection or early coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Secondary analyses examined how pre-HT diagnosis (e.g., single ventricle vs. dilated cardiomyopathy) and patient age affect hemodynamic trends and normalization patterns. We also investigated pressure changes during episodes of rejection and proposed criteria for defining “normalization” of post-HT HDS.

Our findings reveal diagnosis- and age-specific trends in post-HT hemodynamics, with certain patient subgroups demonstrating persistent abnormalities despite clinical stability. These data underscore the importance of personalized benchmarks for expected HDS trajectories and may support refined risk stratification in an era of increasingly non-invasive monitoring protocols.
